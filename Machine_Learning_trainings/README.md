### tasks from virtual team 01
Example of many posiibles in graphs from seaborn library for exploring virtual team task estimation and execution.
We have few columns for excercise:
 - difficulty_from_planning_log
 - days_to_end_from_planning
 - real_day_to_end_after_work_done

General answer is: "if estimation of example tasks in relation to real exetucion time is similar?"
We can see LinearRegresion example with few degrees and many variants of seaborn graphs.
